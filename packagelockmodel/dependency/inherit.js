 * this, but this will also introduce another dependency on another package.
 * Therefore, I did it myself.
 *
 * I don't dislike the concept of prototypes, but the way it's implemented in
 * JavaScript is just too crazy. You have to do some crazy stuff to properly set
 * prototypes, as we cannot control them directly. Anyway, this function
 * abstracts over that burden so that we don't have to repeat this every time.
